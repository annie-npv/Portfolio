#### Project Details: Materials Tracking Access Database

This project involves building a Microsoft Access database to monitor and manage resource usage linked to individuals through a unique identifier. The system comprises two main tables: one that stores personal information and another that tracks the quantity and types of resources used by each individual. The database is designed to allow administrators to update, retrieve, and add new records efficiently, ensuring accurate tracking of resources.

#### Key Functionalities:
1. **Updating Records**: Updates existing records by modifying personal details and associated resource usage based on a unique identifier. This ensures data accuracy and consistency in tracking resources across individuals.

2. **Fetching Records**: Retrieves and displays personal information and associated resource usage for a specific individual based on the unique identifier, allowing for easy monitoring and review of data.

3. **Adding New Records**: Inserts new records for both personal information and resource usage, linking the two through a unique identifier. It prevents duplicate entries, ensuring the integrity of the data.

#### Implication:
The database provides a streamlined approach to tracking and managing resource usage, ensuring accurate allocation and preventing excess usage. By linking personal information with resource consumption data, the system enables effective monitoring and decision-making regarding resource distribution.
