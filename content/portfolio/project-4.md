#### Project Details

Identify trends and assess customer satisfaction in the legal services industry through ABA's raw data. The research explores customer demographics, question categories, sentiment analysis of conversations, and the determinants of commonly asked questions. Machine learning techniques, such as elastic net, random forests, and neural networks, are employed to develop a robust classification model that predicts the most popular question categories based on relevant predictor variables.
